# SDL3 Tutorial

This repository contains code for following [nadako's SDL3 GPU Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLI3kBEQ3yd-CbQfRchF70BPLF9G1HEzhy).
Instead of using the Odin language, the code is written in Jai, with the [sdl3-jai binding](https://github.com/heyaplane/sdl3-jai/tree/main) created by heyaplane.

Each commit contains the code for a video in the serie. To run the project, do the following:

```shell
jai build.jai
```
